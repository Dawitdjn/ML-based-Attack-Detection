# MACHINE LEARNING-BASED ATTACK DETECTION FOR THE INTERNET OF THINGS
In this code, a Grey Wolf Optimizer is used to tune XGBoost binary classifier and an elastic deep autoencoder is optimized using random search with regularization used for feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and SMOTE is used for data balancing.  The optimized elastic deep autoencoder excels in extracting rich feature representations from high-dimensional(CICIoT2023 and CICIDS2017). Overall, the combination of the above techniques significantly advances the detection accuracy with a minimal computational resources.  The results are promising and competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches for IoT intrusion detection.
